**RhettLawson42/RhettLawson42** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: a new resume
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: objectivity
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: collective enlightment
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: finding a new job
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Loom
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: twitter, email, phone
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns are nouns that have lost their amature status.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can throw a grape 30 feet into the air and catch it with my mouth.
